The Google Search Appliance Connector for OpenText includes WSDL
and schema files used to generate the client code for OpenText
Content Web Services. These files were downloaded from a Content
Web Services server with version 10.5.4.401.

The WSDL and schema files were modified in the following ways:

  * The port address location has been changed to an invalid
    address; the correct location is set in the connector code at
    runtime.

  * References to the associated schema files have been changed
    to be local references instead of references to a Content Web
    Services installation.
